        name: "Shore Temple",
        coords: [12.6111, 80.1973],
        summary: "Standing defiant against the Bay of Bengal since the 8th century, this granite structural temple captures the first light of dawn. It is the last survivor of the legendary Seven Pagodas.",
        history: "Built between 700-728 AD during the reign of Narasimhavarman II (Rajasimha), it is one of the oldest structural stone temples in South India. Unlike the rock-cut monuments nearby, this temple was built from blocks of granite. Legend says it was part of a larger complex of seven temples, six of which were submerged by the ocean, a myth partially validated by underwater excavations following the 2004 tsunami.",
        details: "The complex consists of three shrines: the main east-facing Shiva shrine which catches the sunrise, a smaller west-facing Shiva shrine, and a middle shrine dedicated to reclining Vishnu (Anantashayi). The architecture features a pyramidal kutina-type tower, topped with a stupi, and is adorned with intricate carvings of Nandi bulls along the walls.",
        tips: "Visit at sunrise (6:00 AM) for the most magical lighting and fewer crowds. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site ticket, which covers all monuments in the group.",
        facts: ["It functioned as a landmark for mariners in ancient times.", "The 2004 Tsunami unearthed an ancient submerged lion statue nearby.", "The temple is constructed from blocks of granite, not carved from a single rock."]

        name: "Descent of the Ganges",
        coords: [12.6163, 80.1918],
        summary: "A masterpiece of narrative art carved into two giant boulders. It depicts the celestial river Ganges descending from the heavens, witnessed by gods, animals, and sages in intricate detail.",
        history: "Also known as Arjuna's Penance, this 7th-century open-air rock relief is one of the largest in the world (96 by 43 feet). It was created to celebrate the victory of the Pallava dynasty. The cleft between the two rocks was designed to channel water, simulating the descent of the holy river during rain or festivals.",
        details: "The relief is teeming with life: celestial beings (Gandharvas), hunters, sages, and animals. Notable carvings include a cat performing penance (a humorous touch), a family of elephants that are life-sized, and the emaciated figure of a sage (Arjuna or Bhagiratha) standing on one leg.",
        tips: "Look closely at the 'cat ascetic' mimicking the sage—a touch of ancient humor. Visit in the late afternoon when the sun hits the relief directly, highlighting the depth of the carvings.",
        facts: ["Contains over 100 individual figures of gods, humans, and animals.", "The natural cleft was once fitted with a cistern to produce a waterfall effect.", "It tells two stories simultaneously: The Descent of the Ganges and Arjuna's Penance."]

        summary: "Vaanirai Kal (Stone of Sky God) is a 250-ton rock perched precariously on a slope. Defying gravity and attempts to move it, it remains a playful enigma of nature.",
        history: "This glacial boulder has rested on a 45-degree slope for over 1,200 years. The Pallava kings attempted to move it with seven elephants but failed. In 1908, the Governor of Madras also tried to remove it, fearing for the safety of the town below, but the rock did not budge.",
        details: "The rock is approximately 6 meters high and 5 meters wide. The contact point with the hill is surprisingly small, less than 4 square feet, creating a physics-defying illusion of instability. The rock's surface shows evidence of erosion and weathering over millennia.",
        tips: "It's a popular spot for 'holding up the rock' photos. Be careful on the slippery slope around the rock. Great spot for a break in the shade of the rock itself.",
        facts: ["Locally known as 'Vaanirai Kal', meaning Stone of the Sky God.", "It inspired the creation of the 'Tanjavur Doll' which never falls down.", "Weighs approximately 250,000 kilograms."]

        summary: "Five monolithic pyramidal structures named after the Pandavas. Carved from a single large rock, these 'chariots' showcase the evolution of Dravidian architecture.",
        history: "Carved during the reign of Mahendravarman I and his son Narasimhavarman I (630–668 AD), these structures were never consecrated as temples because the rock they were carved from had a fault line. They remained unfinished, preserving a moment in architectural history.",
        details: "Each 'Ratha' (chariot) is carved in a different style, effectively serving as a catalog of South Indian temple designs (Vimanas). The Dharmaraja Ratha is the largest and most complex. Also present are three large monolithic animal sculptures: an elephant, a lion, and a bull (Nandi), each associated with a deity.",
        tips: "Walk around the back of the structures to see the 'unfinished' work, which gives insight into how these monoliths were carved from top to bottom.",
        facts: ["They are monoliths, not assembled buildings.", "Hidden from the world in sand until the British excavated them 200 years ago.", "Named after the Mahabharata heroes, though there is no historical link to them."]

        summary: "A beacon guiding sailors since 1904. Climb the spiral stairs for a panoramic view of the ancient town, the shimmering ocean, and the spread of casuarina trees.",
        history: "While the current circular masonry tower was built by the British in 1904, the site has been a navigational point for two millennia. The nearby Olakkannesvara Temple (built c. 700 AD) on the hillock originally served as a lighthouse, with bonfires lit on its roof to guide trade ships.",
        details: "The tower stands 26 meters tall and is built of natural stone. It uses a flashing light with a range of 24 nautical miles. Next to it is the oldest lighthouse of India - the 7th-century Pallava-era cave temple which was used as a fire-signal station.",
        tips: "The climb is steep and narrow, not recommended for those with knee issues. The view from the top offers the best perspective of the town's geography and the coastline.",
        facts: ["One of the few lighthouses in India with a lift (though often reserved for staff).", "It stands next to India's oldest lighthouse, a simple stone roof-top fire pit.", "Open to tourists only from 10 AM to 5 PM."]
