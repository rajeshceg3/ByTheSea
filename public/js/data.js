        summary: "A timeless sentinel overlooking the Bay of Bengal, the Shore Temple is the crown jewel of Pallava architecture. Built in the 8th century, it was the first structural temple in the region, marking a transition from rock-cut architecture to free-standing stone edifices.",
        history: "Commissioned by Narasimhavarman II (Rajasimha) in the early 8th century, this temple served as a beacon for mariners. It is the sole survivor of the legendary 'Seven Pagodas' described by Marco Polo. The 2004 tsunami briefly exposed the submerged remains of its sister temples, validating ancient myths.",
        details: "The complex features three shrines: the main east-facing Shiva shrine (Kshatriyasimhesvara), capturing the first rays of sunrise; a smaller west-facing Shiva shrine; and a unique middle shrine dedicated to a reclining Vishnu (Anantashayi). The vimanas (towers) are pyramidal and stepped, distinct from later Dravidian curves. Rows of weathered Nandi bulls guard the perimeter walls.",
        tips: "The best time to visit is at sunrise for a golden glow on the granite, or late afternoon for cooler breezes. The entry ticket purchased here is valid for the Five Rathas and Arjuna's Penance on the same day.",
        facts: [
            "It is one of the oldest structural stone temples in South India.",
            "Designed to catch the first rays of the rising sun to illuminate the deity.",
            "Constructed with granite blocks hauled from quarries 50km away.",

        summary: "A colossal open-air bas-relief that turns a massive rock face into a canvas of divine narrative. Also known as Arjuna's Penance, this 7th-century masterpiece is one of the largest rock reliefs in the world.",
        history: "Carved under the patronage of Narasimhavarman I (Mamalla) to celebrate his victory over the Chalukyas. The ambiguity of the central figure—whether it is Arjuna seeking the Pasupata weapon or Bhagiratha bringing the Ganges to earth—suggests a deliberate dual narrative intended to spark intellectual debate among the courtly elite.",
        details: "The relief measures 96 by 43 feet. A natural cleft in the rock represents the River Ganges, once fitted with a cistern to release water during festivals. The carving teems with over 100 figures: gods, nagas, hunters, and animals, all rushing towards the sacred river. Note the 'Cat Ascetic' near the elephant's feet, a humorous fable of a cat feigning piety to catch mice.",
        tips: "Binoculars help in appreciating the upper details. Visit in the late afternoon when the sun hits the relief directly, creating deep shadows that enhance the three-dimensional effect.",
        facts: [
            "Features a life-sized elephant family carved with incredible naturalism.",
            "The 'Cat Ascetic' is a visual pun referencing the Panchatantra tales.",

        history: "This glacial erratic has sat immovable for over 1,200 years. King Narasimhavarman I reportedly failed to move it with seven elephants. In 1908, British Governor Arthur Lawley attempted to remove it fearing it would roll onto the town, but seven elephants again failed to budge it.",
        details: "The rock is approximately 6 meters high and 5 meters wide. Despite its rounded appearance, the back is sheared off flat. The contact point with the hill is shockingly small (less than 4 square feet), creating an illusion of imminent collapse. The varying coloration on the rock face tells the story of centuries of sun and rain.",
        tips: "It’s a perfect spot for fun perspective photography—pretend to hold it up or push it. The shadow of the boulder offers a cool resting spot. Be careful on the slope as the rock surface can be slippery.",
        facts: [
            "Weighs approximately 250,000 kilograms.",

They were never consecrated because the stupis (finials) were never installed, likely due to the king's death. Named after the Pandava brothers, this association is purely legendary with no historical basis.",
        details: "Each Ratha showcases a different roof style: Draupadi (thatched hut), Arjuna (stepped pyramid), Bhima (barrel vault), Dharmaraja (tallest pyramid), and Nakula-Sahadeva (apsidal back). The complex also features three monolithic animals—an elephant, a lion, and a bull—each carved with breathtaking realism.",
        tips: "Walk behind the Rathas to see the unfinished base, which reveals how the carvers worked from top to bottom. This technique ensured that they didn't need scaffolding.",
        facts: [

        details: "The modern lighthouse stands 26 meters tall with a range of 24 nautical miles. The ancient Olakkannesvara Temple is a structural temple dedicated to Shiva (specifically the form 'Flame Eye'). Though its superstructure is lost, the base remains a testament to early structural engineering.",
        tips: "The spiral staircase is steep and narrow; take your time. The view from the top is spectacular—look for the nuclear power plant domes of Kalpakkam to the south and the distant Chennai skyline to the north.",

        details: "Four major panels adorn the walls: the Boar Avatar (Varaha) lifting the Earth Goddess; the Dwarf Avatar (Vamana) transforming into Trivikrama; Goddess Gajalakshmi bathed by elephants; and Durga. The Varaha panel is celebrated for the tender intimacy between the boar-faced god and the rescued Bhumi (Earth).",
